### Notes

- There is not always a right decision.
- Recognize that subjectivity is involved
    - subjective trade-offs
- Be transparent with actions, language, motivations
- Constrained change - a system capable of adaption but no so easily captured.
- Be aware of the conflicts of interest, self-interest (i.e. VCs, founders, etc.)
- Code is Law is **wrong**
    - part of larger conceptual concept - pathetic dot theory
    - fine as long as it is understood it is absolute and immutable thing
    - Modalities (four)
        - norms
        - markets
        - architecture - technical construction of a thing
    - better said as **algorithm is law**
        - can be changed, updated, evolved, etc.
    - in some ways the rules are
        - good/evil
        - lawful/unlawful
    - should evaluate actions
        - **i.e.** MEV - self-serving lawful action (lawful - evil)
- Community is Law
    - if the community is in agreement that a rule needs to be updated then action is taken
- Rules can be changed and should be carefully constrained with a high bar to modify.
- **Reduce** is not the same as **eliminate**
    - what are the side-effects of these actions?
        - do other issues arise elsewhere
- There should be levers to steer the ship and govern people/orgs to change rules/laws/etc.
    - necessary for those who govern and those who are governed
    - allows for modification of rules
- **Supression will surface elsewhere**

### Questions

- How can we implement 'accountability' in DAOs?
    - accountability cannot be implemented
        - rather a norm of being accountable
        - membership body should be aware that actions have ripple affect
- What are our current biases towards ethics? How are they different throughout history? Is one better than the other? if so why?
    - current biases towards ethics is we don't want them to exist - **agree**
    - we act/want there to be one right answer and push ethics away while searching for the perfect answer/thing/rule/code/etc.
        - causes issue when discussing trade-offs or changes
- Why should token engineers feel responsible, if everybody else doesn't in cryptoland?
- What are the professions and critical thinkers we want in a group to determine ethics? is that us? if not how do we attract that group of thought leadership?
