# On Catalyst Swarm 500k GMBL RFT
> RFT - request for token

### GMBL Background
Gimbalabs created a CNT (Cardano Native Token) called the Gimbal (GMBL). The team minted ***1,618,033,988.00 GMBL*** that are planned to be distributed over several [allocations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X5uv-KscMQALvsdqfNyxbFxEUJ_MQ-dgtMZJJ4cVlJc/edit?usp=sharing). The distribution for the first allocation, A0, accounting for 1.32% of all minted GMBL and took place on **12 April 2022**. This data can be found in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ui6Te33_RYB7tX4nRDcToR0s1NYJpX2g3Cxh0OU9-gw/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet. The groups receiving these tokens were created and selected by the [TPBL working group](https://discord.com/channels/767416282198835220/928062517039759441). These teams are referred to as working groups and can be found in the Gimbalabs [Discord](https://discord.gg/stkCVJKtZm) server under the category **Tokenomics PBL**.

### TPBL Facts
When the TPBL working groups were created there was much excitement, motivation and attendance. Why such emotions? Members were about to receive a disbursement of tokens to their personal wallets alongside the working groups' A0 distributions. These newly formed working groups were mostly comprised of the same members that were part of the TPBL genesis. Fifteen (15) groups were created by roughly 30 members. There were meetings, async conversations, document creation, DMs and more. 

As time passed interest waned, working group participation dropped and communications were less frequent, if at all. Peoples' time was spread thin. For most, Gimbalabs and the TPBL were just one responsibility among many others. Coordination became more difficult as Project Catalyst funding rounds came and went, and winning Proposers needed to get to work as they are now obligated to the Cardano community to finish their projects.

There are some working groups that are not so dramatically affected by these series of events and actions, mostly the pre-exisitng communities such as DEMU, Gimbalabs, Little Fish, Cardano 4 Climate and Catalyst Swarm. The majority of the newly created TPBL working groups were at a distinct disadvantage with churn rates too high to even have meetings much less produce anything meaningful.

### Swarm RFT
#### Brief
Catalsyt Swarm, one of the larger organizations in Cardano and has members who are active in the *Connectors, Cross Pollinators, Network Builders, Recruiters* working groups within TPBL. However, the organization's, Catalyst Swarm, intitial GMBL distribution is not public facing. 

With [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xahcslG90OOpJlZoDwFwx2JBNzD4tG163BhTBV-9Kb0/edit#heading=h.6mzoorl6y60v) RFT Catalyst Swarm is requesting another 500,000 GMBL to be drawn against the *Transparency + Data* and *Tokenomics, Treasury, Liquidity* working groups' allocations at 200k and 300k GMBL respectively. 

Catalyst Swarm distributes GMBL through Dework bounties, at times also adding ADA, and as incentives for meeting/session participation. 

There is no claim to know all of the activities performed by Catalyst Swarm and its members.

Swarm provided the following documents for accountability:
- [Swarm GMBL Distribution](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VgajHneZXvpwXfje1-cAES9IfILqDVIMhRhTDJHFvxU/edit#gid=0)
- [Swarm Treasury Distribution](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ZzuxMfoGRm7ys__tZRs9cFDhU2C0wlV/edit#gid=1703630325)

### Motion Against RFT
#### Organizational Size
As briefly described above, Catalyst Swarm was a pre-existing organization that decided to participate in TPBL. This puts them at a distinct advantage given the size of its current community. Shouldn't the other working groups be given time, relative to their size, before dismissing those teams and distributing their funds?

#### Drawing Against *Tokenomics, Treasury, Liquidity*
The request to draw against the titled working group should be immediately rejected. For GMBL this is one of **the** most important working groups repsonsible for creating the economic structure and process modeling for Gimbalabs. This should be the very last of all working groups to be taxed by Catalyst Swarm.

#### Value
Looking at the [Treasury Distribution](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ZzuxMfoGRm7ys__tZRs9cFDhU2C0wlV/edit#gid=1703630325) sheet we can deduce that Swarm has benefited greatly from its intitial allocation. Does this transalte to community, Gimabalab, or GMBL value?

What is the value-add for GMBL, Gimbalabs, and the community, from the initial allocation? What additional or further value can be expected by increasing the allocation? What work has been or will be performed to provide this value? How can TPBL evaluate these areas?

#### Budget
Budgets are limited and are meant to be used repsonsibly. Once an allocation of any item (token, fiat, raw materials) are used up there should be a great expense to acquire more. Removing this burden would assume that both parties are benfiting from excess acquisition. Who are these parties? GMBL, Swarm, Gimbalabs, Cardano, Catalyst.

As far as internal distributions go, based on the above document, 33% of all Gimbal are used for operations labeled as "Swarm." There are no entries related to Gimbalabs. Catalyst Swarm does contribute to Gimbalabs on a monthly basis. If they should receive more tokens based on this alone then it is essentially buying GMBL at the rate of 0.001 USD per GMBL. 

Yes there are many, many minted GMBL but we must be repsonsible and not too hasty with allocations and distributions. When setting precedence there should be much thought, discussion, evaluation.

### Potential Benefits
#### Velocity, Movement
Catalyst Swarm does have the potential to increase the number of GMBL token holders and increase token velocity. The affects are minimal at this time until more use-cases and wallet holders are generated.

#### Audience
Given the number of sub-organizations that Catalyst Swarm operates or is associated with (all Town Halls, WADA, and others) there is the opportunity for a more GMBL and Gimbalabs informed community. Who is the audience, are they unique and information is shared?

#### Insight Sharing, Documentation
Catalyst Swarm could share insight with Gimblabs, the TPBL, and others to help create a proper tokenomics system. 

### Closing
#### Alternative Funding
If the community decides to approve this RFT there is the Catalyst Proposal Facilitation working group has a little over 700K GMBL. The origins of this group are unknown and there are no past or present active members. Ratio13#0578 and whitevo#9715 are the wallet holders.

#### Remarks
Personally I am against any organization, working group, or other entity receiving beyond their initial distribution in a sinlge allocation phase **UNLESS** they can prove that the primary disbursement was intrinsically good for Gimabalabs and the GMBL token. This RFT appears to be a budget request so that Swarm may continue operating with little stress. The documented usage of GMBL has not proved beneficial to Gimbalabs, minus a marginal increase in token holders; to what end?

Some TPBL groups have spent hours wotking towards a goal without having distributed GMBL to those participants or through working projects. These groups should be able to retain their allocations without fear of it being reduced by another participating organization. Actions like this could lead to token consolidation, outsized influence or decreased token value.

#### Suggestions

The community (TPBL and other interested members) should create a template, guidelines and requirements for future RFTs (request for tokens) to include proof of work, utility, and/or value from past disbursements.

Sustainability should be a parameter requirement. If sustainability cannot be reached then who should continue the funding? Who benefits from the faucet-funding? Are there more sustainable and available alternatives? How difficult is it to build out a community maintianed platform? What about donations or grants? If systems exist that require continual funding there is a level of consensus among the affected community(ies) that should be reached.

#### Disclaimer

The words in this document are mine and mine alone. It is up to the community to come up with their own words, ideas, decisions and determine the best path forward. This is not an attack on Swarm or any community member. The questions above should be asked regardless of the requesting entity status or size.
