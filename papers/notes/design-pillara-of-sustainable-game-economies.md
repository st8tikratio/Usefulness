## Notes

> all notes are based on the broad view of economy

> :warning: Money is only money as long as people are willing to take it.

- No other tool that shows the funky weidness of world economy (Machinations)
- **token coins** are equivalent to currency
- currency stability
    - **money** is an old and universal concept
- people will create "money" when, where and if needed
- to burn assets do not use the word "tax"
    - should be as part of the game mechanics
        - **i.e.** ship being sunk and losing NFT

## Pillar One
- a stable currency has all three
    - medium of exhange
    - measure of account
    - store of value

### Currency must be:
- a medium of exchange
    - there has to be a **medium of exchange**
        - there has to be a way to trade tokens
- measure of account
    - player must be able to use money to measure the value of goods
- store of value
    - player must be able to earn it today and spend tomorrow
        - **there must be trust that this is true**
            - short - immediate
            - medium - 
            - long - rainy day

### Currency Instability
- just one of these will destroy the economy
    - **rapid** value gain or loss
    - how quickly are people aware of the changes in the value of their currency
- drops out of use
- has no value
> Currencies get replaced by other objects or money

### Player/User Impact
- encouraging quick purchases to avoid losing value
    - get rid of it quickly to capture the most value
        - buying items for future trade because money is losing value
- encourage hoarding of the "currency"
    - Diablo 2 players stopped using currency and started using Stone of Jordan
    - Ashron's Call changed to multiple items as currency

#### Ex: Gaia online (defunct)
- pumped currency into the game
- introduced random currency drops
    - could buy a package with currency packages
- players had to think about the cost of play in the future
- reduced value of currency
    - introduced chaos, causing people to leave

### Investor Impact
- investors on the whole would like gradual predictable growth.
- if it looks liek a duck, quacks like a duck; it's a duck
    - referencing **bubbles**
        - bubbles can form over anything in the hopes of getting a return
- specualtors will herd into currency causing a rising and unsustainable rise in value

### Inflation
Technically understood as an increase in the cost of a bundle of goods.
- the cost of real goods has increase
#### Machinations examples of currency delfation

**started printing money and reduced the value of the currency**

## Price Rationality
- . . .
- . . . 
- . . . 
### The value of a good in terms of some outside unit of currency
- Bitcoin or Ethereum
### Barter
- the value of the good in echange for another good
### Implicit price
-  no formal exchange taking place or at a fixed price
    -  deelopers don't know what the value is now
    -  what is the true value?
### Fixed prices
-  price is set arbitrarily, without any responsiveness to the the demand of the item
### Starting price
-  price is set srbitrarily, without any responsiveness to the demand for the good
### The Citadel (by Machinations)
- game economy health
#### Sample game economy map
Suggested to build out something simiilar in order to locate loops

> Interest illicitation - how much would you (the survey taker) be willing to pay for an action/item (i.e. Dutch auction)

## Proper Allocation
- Allocation function of an economy refers to the way an economic systemdistributes goods to people
    - pricing system
    - crafting system
    - an holisitc system
    - based on how the user sees the system -- must be fair and equal
    - if it's not fair people will focus on the the inequality
- Reward players for their skills, time and effort
    - the more you put in the more you get out
- **Or** are willing to pay into the economy to reward others
    - to what extenet will different culture accept play to win
- Randomness:
    - code creates and distributes a good as the result of a random numer generator call
        - economist call this **risk**
    - when a player does not know how much his linen cloth will sell for on a player market
        - this is called **uncertainty**
- Fairness
    - people will revolt
    - equality of opportunity
        - starting off at the same spot
    - equality of rewards
        - wage rate
    - perfectly fair is boring
    - some randomness makes a game deep and interesting
    - **pay to win**
        - the inequalities of the real world inevitably influence the distribution of goods in virtual worlds

## Web 3 to consider
- Must **build in** decay in web3 or database inflation
- can lose entire population overnight or have a massive influx

## Best Practices (so far)
- a fact is a statemetn that can be provent o be true
- an opinion is an expression
- beware of nice people offering opinions
- fully test before launching economy
- understand the control points within your economy
    - levers
    - data
    - hooks
- monitor you economy proactively
    - by the time you see inflation impacting your economy it's **too late**

### Cheatsheet
- control the rate of accumulation of assets
- control the rate of destruction of assets

# What are you trying to sell?
**Happiness**
- requires people to trust you and the economy
