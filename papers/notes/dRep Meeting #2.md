    - delegating you voting power to dReps
- dRep
    - Vote as an expert - helkp grow Cardano
    - represent your community
    - gain rewards
- User experience
    - different than dRep
    - delegate with voting key (???)
    - delegation is not anonymous
    - there will be a list of dReps
        - clicking on a dRep shows the dRep profile
    - can delegate to multiple dReps


### Summary

**dRep registration**
- registering is fast and easy, includes POL review
- profiles will be public and searchable in voting center
- dRep can use a vanity handle
- voters who choose to delegate will confirm their delgation in GVC
- post snapshots dReps will have any personal and all delgated voting power add and available
- delegation values reset after each voting round (MVP)

**Voting Center**
- a new/fast way to delegate
- conencted walelt via mobile app
- when available no QR/PIN
- Catalyst Voting app will still be available

### Questions
1. Should dReps create a new QR and PIN
    - connect using the wallet connect
    - idea is to move away from QR Code/PIN

> Once registered to vote no further registration is required in subsequent funds

3. Will stakepool operators be able to register pledge for voting?
    - working with ATADA to create CLI and other

4. Can users form as a dRep?
    - no facilitation
    - it is possible
    - no restrictions
    - dApp allows only one connected wallet

5. Will voters be able to skip dRep delegation
    - once registered user can delgate or vote

6. dReps were required to vote in Fund 8 in order to connect the wallet
    - dReps must vote for Fund 9 
    - dReps cam still create a new wallet

7. Will POL follow GDPL rules?
    - yes, still being worked on
    - blockchain poses issue for complete deletion

8. Is there a testing round for dReps?
    - this is the test (Fund 10) - MVP

9. Can there be a private dRep so others can delegate to other members?
    - will be required to use the CLI or other tools
    - hoping to allow delgation power to a single wallet
    - cap remains in place

10. Is a fee charged to delegators every time they set or change their dRep?
    - yes, choose wisely
    - yes, it is on blockchain

11. What is the minimum amount of ADA a dRep needs to have delegated to be considered active?
    - need a min of 1% for rewards

12. When is the total delgated stake determined

13. What is the difference between staked an
    - total voting stake
        - i.e. 1 bil ADA as a whole
    - total delgated stake
        - i.e. the % of the ADA

14. What voting stake is determined for voting?
    - the snapshot determines this

15. When is the delgated voting stake determined?
    - determined at the snapshot

16. Saturation is based on which stake?
    - voting stake

17. How are the 150 dReps rewards?
    - must be in top 150 of dReps
    - get rewarded proportionally from 0 - $3000
        - depemds on the amount of delegated stake
        - reward may change due to currency change (USD -> ADA)

18. Seems like voting is not the purpose.
    - you're a dRep regardless if you have 1 voter or more

### Other Notes

> There will be a right to be forgotten

> There will be a dRep dashboard for the dRep

> Going to implement a process called pre-snapshot to show delegation saturation before snapshot.

> Voting (delegation saturation) are included sequentialy. Meaning if a dRep is close to saturation and becomes over-saturated at snapshot those who over-saturate the pool will have their voter rewards slashed (or completely removed). **Needs to be confirmed**

> dRep rewards are **only** paid if the dRep receives 1% of the delgated stake

> Over-delgating can diminish voter rewards - slashing

> dReps are required to vote on a **minimum** of 60 proposals and 20 challenge proposals.

> dReps are required to write a short summary as to how they voted.
