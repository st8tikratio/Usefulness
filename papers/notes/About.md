# About

The Cardano Constitution Working Group was created as part of the Gimbalabs Tokenomics PBL with the intentions of exploring constitutional, manifesto type ideas to further Cardano governance, community awareness and discussion. The intent was always to include those who were interested and make all information public and actions transparent. 

While the intitial participation rate was relatively high, respectively, over time the participation level drastically diminished. The Constitution WG lives on here in this documentation. The acutal [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/767416282198835220/958407168174985306) is still live for now and is part of Allocation Zero (A0) of the aforementioned Tokenomics PBL group.

I would like to thank all those who were initial participants of this group with a special shout out to **Sym**. There are other community members who helped in the creation and distribution of the NFT incentives for **survey no. 2** and helped scope down responses from **survey no. 1**. To these members, we greatly appreciate your assistance and input.

To the community, a sincere thank you to those who have participated in the surveys. Without you there would be no survey data, nothing to share, fewer data points and far fewer voices heard (and viewed).
