## Session 2 - 25 Aug 2022 - Simple Modeling

**Machinations is a **Turing Complete** system.**

## Session 3 - 01 Sep 2022 - Nodes

**Machinations only works with integers and no decimals**
- cannot **transfer** fractions or negative numbers
- would require the use of smaller numbers
    - i.e. .0001 = 10000 and everything else follows suit
        - i.e. 10 = 100000000

**Node Elements of Machinations**
- no affiliation with blockchain nodes

**Node bar**
- left hand side of Machinations project window

**Nodes (in order)**
- *Source* - upward triangle with asterick
    - generates a resource
    - infinite resources
- *Pool* - circle
    - will never be negative
- *Drain* - downward triangle
    - destroys resources
    - can be considered any means to use/spend resources
    - can use a **Pool** instead to show spent/burned resources
- *Gate* - diamond
    - controls distribution
        - prioritized by node ID
            - lowest first
    - deterministic
        - follows same rules always
    - random
        - shows dice in the middle
        - a higher percentage signifies a higher chance of receiving resources
    - can also drain resources with precentages that total less than 100% 
    - also called **a middle step node**
        - can speed up depending on the setup
- *Converter* - side triangle with vertical line
    - converts x into (n)y
    - singleton
        - makes on conversion per step
        - can be used with multiple
    - multiple
        - converts as many as possible
        - can be used with singleton
    - if inputs, i.e. resource pools do not have enough resources the converter will stop
- *Trader* - two opposing triangles sharing single vertical line
    - cannot function without color coding
    - trades resources based on logic and color
    - can be considered a **double converter**
    - great where people have low resources
- *Delay* - circle with hour glass
    - holds resources until a certain number of steps
    - can also be used in **Que**
        - subsequent resources are released after a certain number of steps
- *End Condition* - box with black box
    - consition to stop the entire simulation
    - could be "game over"
- *Register* - $fx$
    - [Registers - Documentation](https://machinations.io/docs/registers/)
    - watch the Youtube video and/or webinar -> 102 
    - used for all logic/math in the model
- *Connections*
    - **Resource** - solid line
        - sends resources only
        - has interval and instant transfer modes
            - instant is faster connection
            - interval can send resources every step or **less often**
        - **d10** equivalent to rolling a ten-sided dice
        - **all** works a resource connection label
    - **State** - dotted line
        - never used to transfer resources
        - interacts with the state of the other nodes
            - +1 indicates the same is resource is placed on the other node
            - +2 doubles the resources on the other node
        - a drain attached to the left node will remove resources from the right node
        - example
            - source -> pool -> state connection -> pool -> drain
                - allows developer to track rewards and spending
        - can have a filter assigned as well
        - can also influence the resource connection

**Node states**
- passive
    - requires external trigger
- interactive
    - double edged node
    - only performs action when clicked on
- automatic
    - performs action at every step
- enabling
    - performs action the first time it is activated during execution and then stops

**If your model is only concerned with wins then only show wins in the model and do not show loses**

**Color Coding**
- resources can be 
    - black 
    - red 
    - green 
    - blue 
    - orange
