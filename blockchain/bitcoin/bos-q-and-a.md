ðŸ§µ$BOS TOKEN FAQ

Hey BOSes! ðŸ«µ

Weâ€™ve gathered together some of your most pressing questions about $BOS token. Weâ€™re here to provide transparency, alleviate your concerns, and dispel some myths. 

Why does $BOS token exist? Why a presale? What happened to BTC? Is this a scam?ðŸ‘‡
WHAT IS $BOS TOKEN?

$BOS is like the â€˜gasâ€™ token for Bitcoin compute. It is used to pay the marketplace of actors that are involved in performing zero-knowledge cryptography on Bitcoin as part of the BitcoinOS system, including provers, verifiers, sequencers, and integrators.

You can also think of it as the glue that holds the BitcoinOS ecosystem together, helping channel its network effects.
WHY DOES BitcoinOS NEED $BOS TOKEN?

Technically, it doesnâ€™t. None of the systems that are part of BitcoinOS *need* the $BOS token to function. All of the services involved could be provided with BTC.

However, by including the $BOS token, the BitcoinOS ecosystem as a whole â€“ including Bitcoin, Cardano, and other integrated chains â€“ becomes far more *useful* than it would be otherwise.

Fundamentally, BitcoinOS faces a coordination problem. It requires:

âœ…Robust, always on liveness of a ZK verifier set
âœ…Marketplace for compute
âœ…Cross-chain interoperability of BTC + other tokens
âœ…Common accounting language for token prices across many chains
âœ…Bootstrapping the system to be unified from Day 1, instead of fragmenting into many systems that canâ€™t talk to each other.

Typically, the coordination of these services would require placing a company or a new blockchain in the middle that provides a service level agreement (SLA) including guaranteed liveness and tools for interoperability. But that would be centralized - and we obviously donâ€™t want that.

Hence, we have BitcoinOS, and we have $BOS token.

Having a widely distributed token like $BOS thatâ€™s built with the right incentives will help us bootstrap a decentralized SLA from Day 1 that keeps everyone tightly coordinated.

Without this unity, weâ€™d likely end up with many fragmented rollups, tokens, L2s, and L1s using BOS, all with worse security and isolated liquidity and users, much like Ethereumâ€™s rollup ecosystem. With BitcoinOS, we intend for Bitcoin to avoid that fate.
WHAT ARE THE UTILITIES OF $BOS TOKEN?

$BOS token is gas that can be used to pay BitcoinOS node operators for providing cross-chain services that require compute, such as cryptographic bridging. It may also be used as a ticket for users to become members of the operator set themselves.

Since BitcoinOS is an honest singleton (1 of N) security system, owning $BOS to become an operator will effectively make the system trustless for you. Average users not running a node will still enjoy the highly robust 1-of-N trust model.

Note that $BOS is *not* a governance token â€“ BitcoinOS will not be actively governed.
DO I HAVE TO OWN $BOS TO USE BitcoinOS?

Nope!

Bitcoin users of BitcoinOS can still continue to pay fees in BTC. Any conversion of fees into $BOS token needed to pay operators will be abstracted away from end users â€“ much like an internal version of Cardanoâ€™s Babel fees for BitcoinOS. 

$BOS is *only needed* for BitcoinOS power users who choose to become operators themselves. The majority of BitcoinOS users are not expected to do this, and thatâ€™s okay â€“ much like most Bitcoin users donâ€™t run their own Bitcoin full node.

We understand the importance of making the average user experience seamless by allowing them to pay fees with their preferred asset. Ideally, if the BitcoinOS mission succeeds, the entire system should eventually be so seamless that it becomes invisible to most people.
DOES $BOS COMPETE WITH BTC OR OTHER TOKENS?

$BTC, $BOS, and other tokens are very different assets. They do not compete â€“ they complement each other.

$BTC is sound money, and the digital reserve asset of choice for institutions and governments today.

$BOS is the glue that will bootstrap Bitcoin, and other ecosystems into a unified whole via BitcoinOS. This will help create a digital free market between all blockchains to best service end users.
WHAT CHAIN WILL $BOS TOKEN BE ISSUED ON?

Contrary to some rumors, $BOS will not be an ERC-20 token. 

$BOS will be a first-of-its-kind programmable token on Bitcoin!

When a smart contract generates a ZK proof, and that ZK proof is written to Bitcoin, the transaction that does so can include additional metadata that can be read as a token, which is transferable using a Bitcoin wallet.

These tokens will be very special, as they will be programmable unlike BRC-20 tokens or Runes until this point. We can even turn BTC itself into a programmable token through a special kind of wrapping, analogous to WETH for the Ethereum network. 

In the short term, however, the token may need to be distributed on another network before it actually *launches* on Bitcoin. Weâ€™re considering our options for that - Cardano being one of them.
