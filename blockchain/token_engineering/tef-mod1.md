### Part 1. Towards a Practice of Token Engineering, Trent McConaghy (2018)

In 2017, Trent has been working on the incentive design of his own project, Ocean Protocol. In the process of formalizing various approaches he took, he found many similarities to computer-aided design in electrical engineering, the domain he has been doing research in for several years.

Applying the patterns of designing optimizers to token design turned out to be a powerful approach. This was the starting point for three articles about the practice of token engineering - and the first mention of this new discipline.

We call it token engineering – building on cryptoeconomics, the scientific discipline – because it combines the core aspects of any engineering discipline: a body of theory, tools that reconcile theory with practice, and a sense of responsibility over what is being designed.

In the following articles you will explore the beginnings of token engineering, and see how the early definitions of this field still prevail.

### Part 2. Foundations of Cryptoeconomic Systems, Shermin Voshmgir, Michael Zargham (2020)

In 2020, Shermin Voshmgir and Michael Zargham published the paper "Foundations of Cryptoeconomic Systems". In this paper, they map out the history of this term and explore context-dependent definitions of cryptoeconomic systems in complementary micro, meso, and macro views.

This framework is the result of examinations of cryptoeconomic systems through the lens of complex systems, interdisciplinarity, institutional economics, the evolution of cooperation, multi-scale systems, network science, and tokens as systems state.

As such, the paper is a must-read to understand the theory behind token engineering. Watch the video to learn more about the work of Shermin and Michael, and find the link to the paper below.

### Part 3. The Web3 Sustainability Loop, Trent McConaghy (2020)

How can tokens drive the long-term sustainability of a network?

Trent McConaghy shows that we can draw from successful models in businesses and national economies. The design principles Trent introduced in 2018 have guided the macro design for Ocean Protocol since then. It's in many ways a helpful framework to map out a token system's value drivers and make a network flourish long-term.

And by the way, the Ocean sustainability loop was the first use case of TokenSPICE, an agent-based simulator for token systems with smart contracts in the loop.

### Part 4. Cryptonetwork Governance as Capital, Joel Monegro (2019)

Earlier in this module, we’ve discussed the similarities of crypto networks, nation states and companies.

In this chapter we'll come back to this comparison, focusing on governance. Compared to governance in nations states, crypto networks differ. In (democratic) nation states, governance rights are tied to the concept of citizenship, defining the relationship between a state and a real-world individual. Similarly, corporate governance is defining a relationship between known private or public legal entities.

In crypto, this relationship is defined in a very different fashion. With governance tokens, rights to participate in governance are tied to tokens held in (anonymous) wallets, that can itself be governed by (anonymous) groups of individuals, legal entities or even AI.

And second, if these governance tokens can be transferred, they can be traded, valued and modeled by the market. Thus, this new form of 'citizenship' can be priced.

Joel Monegro maps out these innovations in his article 'Cryptonetwork Governance as Capital'. In the Bankless podcast he expands on this, describing crypto systems as the new instrumental layer for social networks that allows for the 'least amount of governance possible'.

We’d like to invite you to dig in, and explore what tokenized governance as a capital asset can mean for our future networks, in all its fascinating – or dystopian – facets.

Finally, Module 6 of TE Fundamentals will be a whole course about token-based governance. Make sure you don't miss it!

- Joel Monegro (2019) - Capital is, in essence, the power to organize the economic resources of a social system, and its worth a function of how much of those resources can be directed to the holder’s benefit.

### Part 5. Engineering Ethics in Web3, Michael Zargham (2021)

The systems and algorithms we build will have a direct impact on human life. If we wish to see these systems thrive in the long-term, engineers need to consider their responsibility to the public. 

But, who should take the burden of safe-guarding the public in decentralized crypto networks, if no regulatory (nation state) authority demands it?

This is the key question Michael Zargham elaborates on with his article "Engineering Ethics in Web3". He takes us on a journey back to the origins of engineering ethics more than 2000 years ago, and shows why approaching Web3 systems as cyber-physical systems can help us in finding ethical principles for crypto-networks as new social institutions.
